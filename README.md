# Final Project - Segment 1 #

##<b>Oregon Fire Analysis and Prediction (1993-2017)</b>##

###<b>Backround</b>###
As data analysts we want to use our skills to help our local and global communities, so for this project we wanted to explore an issue regarding climate-change. As Oregonians the issue of wildfires is of recurring relevance to our lives. After decades of ever-more frequent wildfires Oregon saw its worst fire season in 2021. With average temperatures continuing to rise locally and around the globe, the situation shows no signs of slowing. 
We discovered a great dataset with which to explore this topic. This data is from Kaggle and includes an SQLite file and various CSV files containing data about 1.88 million US wildfires over 25 years.

<p><b>Questions we hope to answer in the coming weeks:</b></p>
<p>• Have wildfires in Oregon increased in frequency?</p>
<p>• Have Oregon wildfires increased in size over time?</p>
<p>• Has Oregon wildfire season changed over time?</p>
<p>• Using machine-learning can we predict how wildfires may change in the next 5 years?</p>
<p>• Can we determine which areas of the State are of higher-risk?</p>

###<b>Plan</b>###
We will communicate primarily through Slack over the next few weeks, with check-ins on Saturdays and Sundays, as well as during class time. For the first segment Nina explored the raw data and cleaned it up for use. Alex explored possible machine learning options. Jovan created the repository and documented the process.
